# Ruby
I decided to look at Ruby as a programming language. I wanted to get into Rails as my ultimate end goal as Ruby is simply a progamming language and Rails is a full MVC framework using Ruby. I had issues installing rails on my computer so I decided to simply use the Ruby language to create a form in my terminal that would do half of my solo project data collection and scoring.

# Ruby vs. JavaScript
Ruby and JavaScript are both object oriented scripting languages. Some differences are in Ruby semicolons are not needed. Methods and loops seem to not needs parentheses and overall the ruby language has much less syntactical punctuation than JavaScript does.

# My Example
This example is very basic and uses some inputs and prompts from the user to define 5 variables (plus the user's name). The script then aggregates and scores the input data based on predefined reference ranges and gives the user a score out of 10 points. Obviously the more points, the better.

# Future Goals
In the future, I would obviously pursue using Ruby within the Rails framework to create a full stack applicatiomn with data storage and data being rendered on the dom.
